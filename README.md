# Machine-Learning-Exercises-Collection
This repository is a collection of my hands-on exercises and implementations of various machine learning models and algorithms. It documents my journey of learning and experimenting with concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, neural networks, and more. Each exercise includes code, explanations, and datasets that I've worked on to deepen my understanding and apply machine learning techniques effectively. This repository serves as both a personal practice space and a resource for others who are on a similar learning path.

# Key Features:

- My implementations of popular ML algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, SVM, k-means, etc.).

- Exercises with step-by-step explanations and comments based on my learning process.

- Use Kaggle Datasets for practice and experimentation.

- Organized by model type and difficulty level for easy navigation.

Comments are welcome!
